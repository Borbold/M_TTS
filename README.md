Purpose:
The main goal of the M_TTS project is to create a faithful adaptation of The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind within Tabletop Simulator. This mod will allow players to enjoy Morrowind's game mechanics, quests, and history in tabletop mode, with miniatures, maps, and interactive elements, while benefiting from an elaborate and automated system.
